# Compiler
Principles and Techniques of Compilers Course Project

This project implements a compiler for a small class C language (C--).
This Compiler converts C-source codew into MIPS assembly code, which could be run on the SPIM Simulator.
The whole project could be divided into four phases: lexical and grammatical analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, and object code generation.
